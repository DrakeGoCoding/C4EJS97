- events happen due to external impact (mouse, keyboard, screen touch, ...)
    ex: click, right-click, double-click,
        key-press, key-down, key-up,
        on-load, on-error, ...

- event handlers:

+ HTML: use HTML properties 
    on + event name = ""

+ JS: use dom and addEventListener('event name', function())

- event variable
    * event
    * this : event DOM
